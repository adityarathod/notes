# Similarity & Dissimilarity Measures
#wiki #cs4375 

## About measures
**Similarity measures** are numerical measures of how alike two objects are. A higher value means two data objects are more alike. They are often in the range $[0,1]$.

**Dissimilarity measures** are numerical measures of how different two objects are. A higher value means two objects are less alike. These measures are bounded by 0 on the low end and can vary on the high end.

## For nominal attributes
### Similarity
$$s=\begin{cases}1 & \text{if } x=y,\\ 0 & \text{if } x \neq y\end{cases}$$

### Dissimilarity
$$d=\begin{cases}0 & \text{if } x=y,\\ 1 & \text{if } x \neq y\end{cases}$$

## For ordinal attributes
Where values are mapped to $0$ to $n-1$ and $n$ is the number of values.

### Similarity
$$s=1-\frac{|x-y|}{n-1} = 1-d$$

### Dissimilarity
$$d = \frac{|x-y|}{n-1}$$


## For intervals or ratios
### Similarity
$$s = -d$$
$$s=1/(1+d)$$
$$s=e^{-d}$$
$$s=1-\frac{(d-\min d)}{(\max d-\min d)}$$

### Dissimilarity
$$d = |x-y|$$
