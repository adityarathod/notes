# State Machine
#wiki #cs3377 

A **finite-state machine** or **finite-state automaton** is a mathematical model of computation used to design programs and circuits.

State machines are visualized as abstract machines that can be in a finite number of _states_, of which the machine can be in only one at a time (the *current state*). The machine's state can be changed via a *state transition*. FSMs are defined as a list of states and conditions for state transitions.

State machines can be used to recognize or generate **regular languages** (see [[formal-language-theory]]), which means we can use them to efficiently implement a [[regex]].
