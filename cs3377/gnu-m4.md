# GNU M4
#wiki #cs3377 

**GNU M4** is a macro processor that copies the input it is given while expanding _macros_ as it progresses.

At the most basic level, M4 can be used for simple embedded text replacement, but it can also serve as an advanced language for building build systems (see [[autoconf]]).

This works very similar to the preprocessor built into many compilers.

## Example
```m4
define(AUTHOR, William Shakespeare)
A Midsummer Night's Dream
by AUTHOR
```

returns

```text
A Midsummer Night's Dream
by William Shakespeare
```
