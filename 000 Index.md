**Note**: If you're a noob to my notes, start here!

These notes are organized to be as flatly organized as possible. Tags are used to differentiate between classes/topics and note types. To view notes by class, either open this vault in Obsidian or view each Class Index. To view notes by type, you must open this vault in Obsidian.
