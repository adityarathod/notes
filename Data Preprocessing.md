# Data Preprocessing
#wiki #cs4375 

Modifications to the data done before utilizing the data to draw conclusions.

This may be done for a variety of reasons. Processing the entire dataset may be too expensive or time consuming, or may introduce data quality issues such as [[Datasets & Data Objects#^cbcc83|noise]] or [[Datasets & Data Objects#^a46391|outliers]].

There are multiple types of data preprocessing:
- [[Aggregation]]
- [[Sampling]]
- [[Dimensionality Reduction]]
- [[Feature Subset Selection]]
- [[Feature Creation]]
- [[Discretization]]
- [[Binarization]]
