#wiki #cs3377 

The field of **formal language theory** studies the structure/syntax of languages. Formal language theory is a field that branched out of linguistics (in which the concepts were used to study syntactic regularity of natural languages).

In formal language theory, you may study **natural languages** or **formal languages**.

## Formal Languages
 **Formal languages** are used as the basis for defining the grammar of programming languages and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent *semantics* or specific meanings.
 
 
### Regular Languages
A subset of formal languages, **regular languages** are languages that can be expressed via a regular expression.
