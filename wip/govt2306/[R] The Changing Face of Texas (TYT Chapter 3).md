# TYT Chapter 3

- Texas was an interesting place because it was the last great frontier
- However, in the last 1.5 centuries, Texas has transitioned from a rural to urban state
    - 2/5 largest metropolitan areas in Texas
- Texas is currently undergoing two transformations:
    - Change in racial makeup thanks to the 5th and 6th migrations of Texas
        - 5th migration: collapse of Rust Belt and pushed midwesterners to the previously-blue state (now red0
        - 6th migration: still occurring, will make Hispanics outnumber Anglos in Texas, 54m people by 2050 (second only to CA, which projected to be 60m)

# Rural-Urban Transitions

- As the state continues to increase in population, urban perspectives will dominate the culture in Texas
- Urbanization has an impact on representation in politics—with an unevenly-distributed population leading to fewer State House and State Senate seats, leading to less representation of rural areas in the legislature
- Nowadays, a lot of towns in rural areas are being abandoned
    - But those towns were ironically driven by technological development initially but many were obsoleted via mechanization of agriculture
- While rural has been defined usually as the opposite of urban, it actually is less of a definition
    - Rural ≠ agriculture due to the change in economic incentives

# Changing Political Economy

- Urbanization of Texas makes it an attractive place to move, particularly to F500 companies
- Texas exports total $251bn per annum—next closest is CA $165bn
- Texas is the #1 trading partner with MX

## Oil and Gas Industry

- The shale revolution really revitalized oil in Texas (before, it had been largely muted since the 80s)
- Shale revolution nearly doubled US oil production
- The US is competitive in natural gas production ($2-3 per mcf) in comparison to other countries
    - Qatar sells at $0.75 per mcf, but does not have enough of a workforce or capacity
- Unbanning of crude oil export and natural gas created even more economic opportunity
- Texas produces other types of energy too—biggest wind energy production (40 mwH, 2014)

## Agriculture

- Starting in 2010, Texas faced a drought, caused by oil and gas extraction techniques
- Ranches were forced to thin their herds to reduce usage of feed
- However, agriculture continues to drive a significant portion of Texas economy
    - Agricultural exports, such as cotton, cottonseed, and beef
    - Recent legislation may increase margins for spirits manufacturers
- Wine production is also a thing, as well as olive cultivation

## Technology

- New companies are appearing in the Austin and Dallas tech scenes, both startups and established companies
- Biotech plays a big role too—Kimberly-Clark, Celanese, Greatbatch, KCI, Cyberonics
- The reason why IT is so big nowadays is because of outsourcing of things like payroll, data entry, support, web design, etc.
- Manufacturing has gone down due to outsourcing and productivity (we have less people to work on things)
- For this trend to continue, Texas needs to continue to attract more successful startups and companies similar to Silicon Valley

# Future Trends

- There may be future jobs focused on maintaining existing standards of living thanks to waste and climate change
- The Texas education system continues to lag behind those in other states—may be a point of focus in the future

## Demographic Shifts in Texas

- Hispanic population is forecast to grow, but they have low socioeconomic resources
- Household income will go gown if nothing is done
- However, if we pushed educational attainment up, poverty will go down, tax revenues will go up, and income levels would too
    - 50% of the variance in lifetime earnings inequality is determined by 18
    - A 5% increase in Texas male HS graduation rates may save the state $428 million in crime-related costs
    - A 5% increase in Texas male college attendance rates would lead to $263 million annually for Texas
- Educational attainment is an important issue for poor and minority populations, and serves to break the systematic barriers holding certain groups back
    - High quality parenting, better early education could really benefit the population
- Demographically, Texas is at an advantage, given that the population tends to be 2-4 years younger than the rest of the US (which consists of aging baby boomers)
- The education problem is tough, particularly in higher ed:

> Ironically, many economically disadvantaged but high-achieving students pay more to attend two-year or nonselective four-year institutions than they would to attend more selective colleges because such schools provide generous nondebt financial aid to students from poor families.
