title: Texas History - Rulers and Revolutionaries
---
# Intro
- The story of Texas is at the heart of the mythology of the West
- Texas was seen as a frontier, where people could flee bad situations and start anew
    - This fits in with the concept of Manifest Destiny, which claims it was part of God's will for settlers to expand westwards and spread their culture
    - Rugged individualism + spirit of independence is seen as a reason for victory in the Texas Revolution
- In fact, the Texas Revolution has shaped political discourse ever since the Republic was born
    - Politicians have likened their campaigns to this mythology
- Recent scholars have redefined the frontier myth to include the spread of other cultures

# The Native People of Texas

- The original settlers of Texas made their way across the Bering Strait and established many groups of native people
- They traveled by foot and had not invented the wheel yet

# The Spanish

- When the Spanish first arrived to Texas, they encountered the Karankawa people due to a shipwreck
- They traded with them for a few years, but then died from illness and war, leaving only 3 people
- They tried to find the Spanish settlement in Mexico but were captured by the Karankawas and were enslaved for two years
- Eventually, they found some Spanish slave catchers whom they followed to Mexico City, where they told their tale to other Spanish people (embellished with stories of gold)
    - They found no gold, but discovered a good portion of the land and its resources
- Texas was treated by the Spanish as a buffer zone between their Mexico colonies and the English settlements

# France's Claim to Texas

- France laid claim to what is now Louisiana
- Spanish got mad (and was warring with France) so aimed to keep the French out to find the colony and destroy it
- Turns out the Karankawas had beat them to it (burnt it to the ground)
- To prevent French from trying again, the Spanish continued trying to settle Texas
    - However, they infected the Caddo with smallpox, and aimed to kill the Spanish
    - This forced the Spanish to close their missions
- To protect Spanish settlements, presidios were built
- Luckily with France's loss to ally England in the French and Indian war, Spain didn't have to worry about France anymore and forced them to reconsider the role of the missions and presidios
- They had people consolidate while giving away some land to landlords who developed large cattle ranches
- Unfortunately, while the Spanish empire flourished, they had trouble making people live in and colonize New Spain
    - This is why they allowed Anglo-American settlers to immigrate to Upper Louisiana, paving the way for Anglo-American migration to Texas
- Moses Austin was the first man to gain permission to bring Anglo-American settlers to Spanish texas
    - Famous as the founder of the American lead industry
    - He died of pneumonia while traveling to get the permissions needed, so his son would be able to complete his father's mission

# Mexican Texas

- In 1821, the Spanish regime was overthrown in Mexico
    - At that time, the population of Texas had been quite diverse, from ranchers to Anglo homesteaders, European merchants, and Native American tribes
- The new Mexico was strapped for cash due to the expensive revolution
    - Because of this, they encouraged empresarios to bring Anglo settlers to NE Texas to develop the area
        - This expansion also served as a block against Native American raids and US expansion
- Stephen F. Austin tried to continue his father's mission
    - He had to permit slavery because of how profitable it would be to farm cotton, and brought over Anglo-Americans from the US South
        - Since one man couldn't grow and pick enough to grow it as a cash crop, and if land was cheap, nobody would work for one another, it would be impossible to hire free labor
        - As such, slavery was implicitly allowed on those land grants (80 acres per slave)
- A chief concern of the people of Texas (esp. those who moved from the US) was the potential annexation of Texas ^dc603e
    - The US was indeed trying to annex Texasâ€”US made an offer but was rejected
    - Mexico was extremely wary of this, and their fears were confirmed when a small group of Anglo settlers were led in a rebellion to gain independence in East Texas
        - This place was called Fredonian Republic, but largely failed due to Stephen F. Austin's efforts to put it down
- Austin managed to (by 1830) have 10k Anglo-Americans in Texas, outnumbering those of Mexican/Spanish descent
    - Many of them squatted on land that wasn't granted to them
    - This only served to increase Anglo-Mexican tensions

# The Law of 1830

- The Law of 1830 curtailed American immigration to Texas, terminated all unfulfilled empresario contracts, prohibited slavery, and called for customs duties on imports/exports
    - This went against Stephen Austin's entire enterprise and was a shocking surprise
- This further intensified Anglo-Mexican tensions
- A man named Davis Bradburn was tasked with enforcing customs laws, but only ended up antagonizing the settlers
- The settlers forced troops out of multiple cities and demanded repeal of the Law of 1830 as well as statehood within the Mexican republic
- The new president, General Antonio Lopez Santa Anna, had abolished the Constitution and placed states under control of the military
- While the petition was initially ignored, it was then seen as an act of treason and threw Austin in prison
    - Eventually, he was release in Spring 1835, with a resolve for war

# The Texas Revolution

- In Gonzales, Mexico, the first shots of the Texas Revolution were fired (October 2, 1835)
- By the end of 1835, with Stephen F. Austin as their commander, the Mexican Army had been driven out of Texas
- The group (called Texians) declared independence and borrowed heavily from Locke and Jefferson in their declaration (but codified racial discrimination)

# The Alamo

- Once San Antonio was reclaimed, most Texian volunteer fighters went home
- Sam Houston was concerned about the defense of the Alamo ("the key to Texas")
    - He sent Jim Bowie to join James Clinton Neill, as well as William B. Travis
        - Travis and Bowie shared command
- Santa Anna came with 1500 troops and the people in the mission faced a dire scenario
- Feb 24: Travis was left in charge when Bowie developed a respiratory illness
- March 3: He asked for reinforcements and none came
- March 5: Santa Anna told his officers that the assault would begin the next day
- March 6, 5am: Battle began, Alamo surrounded from all sides
    - Travis, Bowie, and Davy Crockett were all killed and had their bodies burnt
- March 7: Houston reaches Gonzales and hears of the Alamo, orders men to move east
- Days after, another Texas detachment was surrounded and captured
    - All men were killed
    - Served to strengthen Texas forces' resolve
- April 21, 1836: Houston's army attacked Mexican forces at San Jacinto
    - They could not find Santa Anna, but quickly found him hiding
- With the threat of execution, Santa Anna was forced to recognize the independence of Texas and established the Rio Grande as the southern border
- Sam Houston was the president of the new republic, while Stephen F. Austin became SecState
    - Houston requested annexation of Texas by sending Santa Anna
- The revolution was not to form a nation, but rather to get annexed by the US
    - The revolutionaries saw themselves as Americans
