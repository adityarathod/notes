title: The Political Culture, People, and Economy of Texas
---

# Texas Political Culture

- Political culture = the broadly-shared values, beliefs, and attitudes about how the government should function and politics should operate
- The political culture of a state determines its political nature and defines how individuals and institutions interact
- Texas has a "traditionalistic individualistic" political culture, which believes that government should be dominated by political elites and guided by tradition
    - As a result, people defer to political elites, and taxes/social services are reduced
- However, this culture is a culmination of Texas's history and varies from place to place (urban areas are more liberal, suburban/exurban areas are more conservative)

## The One-Party State Persists

- Texas used to be dominated by Democratic Party until 1978, when William Clements (R) won the governorship
- In the 1990s, there was a fight for control, and in 2002 a redistricting turned the state legislature red
- From 2002-2016 every major statewide office was controlled by Republicans, and most people think this will hold in the near future
- However, change does seem to be on the horizon:
    - The GOP is becoming increasingly divided, with moderate pro-business supporters clashing with cultural conservatives (particularly on things like marriage, borders, and school choice)
    - Increasingly-populated urban areas are Democratic strongholds, with voters championing pro-choice, LGBT rights, and public education
    - Young Latinos and POC are increasingly participating in politics as well

**Commentary**: We saw in 2020 how races in Texas are becoming closer and closer. Young people are shaping to be a big influence in the future.

## Provincialism

- Provincialism = a narrow, limited, and self-interested view of the world often associated with rural values and notions of a limited government
- The popular politicians in Texas have adopted such attitudes, which have resulted in an intolerance for diversity and the idea that social services and education spending is bad for the public interest
- Racism and intolerance underly provincialism, but is increasingly being undercut by urbanization, minority influence, and global business influences

## Business Dominance

- Texas politics is dominated by big business
    - Labor unions are rare
    - Consumer interest groups are poorly-organized and not well-funded
    - Business groups play a big role in politics, as measured by campaign contributions, organized interest groups, and lobbying

# The Land

- In the beginning, Texas privatized a lot of its public land to make money but retained claim to the minerals and other natural resources underneath this land
- They also gave away 67 million acres of land for 10 million dollars in federal bonds (now New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma)

## The Gulf Costal Plains

- The eastern portion of this region is hilly and covered by forests
    - Main production: timber, oil
- The western portion contains the Blackland Belt, a prime farming area in the 19th and 20th centuries, while it is a manufacturing region today
- Texas political life grew out of this region due to land grants offered to Americans
    - This was the birthplace of plantation slavery and Jim Crow segregation in TX
    - The DFW area was once a bastion of a small Republican party, but a labor union movement has changed the dynamics of this region, along with urbanization in Houston and DFW areas
    - Today, this area is increasingly Democratic in urban areas, while becoming increasingly Republican in suburban areas

## The Great Plains

- Define the terrain in most of western Texas
- Dominated by ranching and petroleum production in the north, while focusing on agriculture and cotton production in the south
- Conservative political values are king here

## The Basin and Range Province

- Mountainous region bordering NM
- Has a distinctive political culture because this region is overwhelmingly Latino
    - Predominantly Democratic

# Economic Change in Texas

- Technology has defined and redefined the economy of Texas
- Technological development kind of fell into three waves:
    - Cotton production + cattle & distribution by railroad
    - Petrochemical enhancements
    - High-tech digital economy

## Cotton

- One of the oldest crops grown in Texas—at its peak, TX was 8th highest cotton producer in the US
- Key technological innovations that helped the cotton industry:
    - Barbed wire – allowed farmers to protect their crop from grazing cattle
    - Railroads – created a national market for farmers' production
- Throughout the 1870s immigrants from the Deep South and Europe came to farm cotton and served as either tenant farmers or sharecroppers
    - Tenants managed farms owned by others, providing their own materials while receiving 2/3 of the crop while 1/3 went to the landlord
    - Sharecroppers (a subset of tenant farmers) provided only labor and received only half of their crop
- This system of tenant/sharecropping led to social/economic dependency and fueled radical political discontent (Grange and Populist movements, which defined Texas politics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries)
- Cotton production wavered around the early 20th century, WWII created a decline in cotton culture

## Cattle

- Mirrors the history of cotton, with things like barbed wire really helping
- Conflicts often arose among ranchers and two other groups:
    - Farmers
    - The ranchers' employees (business conflicts as this industry became specialized)
- In the 20th century, remained a cyclical industry
- Today, ranching and cotton remain important industries, but dominated by agribusiness companies
    - 40% of US cotton comes from TX
    - Note that this no longer drives the Texas economy

## Oil

- In the early 20th century, oil became a dominant factor in the economy
- January 10, 1901: Spindletop was discovered and catapulted Texas into the era of oil and gas
- Oil transformed the social and economic fabric of TX
    - Farms/factories increased efficiency, reducing need for labor, pushed manufacturing
        - Displaced workers created rapid urbanization
    - Automobiles became a bigger deal and roads were made (highways)
    - Rapid industrialization of the Gulf Coast
- Oil changed the seasonality of the Texas economy due to the previous link to agriculture
    - Created boom-or-bust mentality, boomtowns had strained resources and quickly turned into ghost towns when oil dried up
- Such a boom also transformed the role the state government played in the economy
    - Increased oil regulation:
        - Common carry in oil pipelines
        - Well-spacing rules
        - Prorating of oil
    - Because oil and natural gas production is taxed (via severance tax), makes up a big part of the state's income
- Oil income also allowed for money to go to schools—is one of the biggest endowments in the world ($19.5 billion)
    - Oil profits on university land are distributed to UT System and A&M schools
    - 2.1 million acres across 24 counties
- When oil prices started tanking, the state went through two major recessions in the 80s, marking the end of oil's driving force in TX's economy

## High-Tech Industry

- Tech became a big part of the Texas economy in the 90s, when it went from 7th in manufacturing employment to 2nd
- DFW and Austin-San Marcos metro areas serve this community, while Houston has a growing number of medical manufacturers

## NAFTA, USMCA, and the International Economy

- The controversial NAFTA aimed to make North America a free trade zone
- Texas has benefitted greatly from NAFTA, along with Mexico (although Mexico has benefitted the most)
    - Although 683k jobs have been lost in the US due to NAFTA (55k in Texas alone), it has netted Texas a lot of benefit. $264bn exports (2017)
- However, this agreement has become more politicized due to the Trump admin, and NAFTA was replaced by USMCA

## The Military in Texas

- Economic development has also been closely tied to military bases
- Opened originally to protect against Native American "invaders," they continue to be important to the economic success to parts of TX
    - As such, an expanding military is beneficial to the state

## The Great Recession and the "Texas Miracle"

- The Great Recession wrecked the US economy, but TX was the last to enter it and the first to exit
- Politicians took credit for this and pointer to struggling high tax states (like CA)
- However, the real reason is economic—the housing market declined less in Texas due to the lower surges in real estate values in comparison to those found in other states before the recession, and because of a constitutional rule that prevented home-equity loans to be used for credit that exceeds 80% of the mortgage
- Social conservatism and economic conservatism clashed over the transgender bathroom issue in TX

# The People of Texas

- The population of Texas has grown rapidly since 1850
- Factors contributing to population growth: natural increase, international immigration, and domestic immigration
    - While in the early days population growth could be attributed to just a natural increase, today immigration from other states and other countries is what causes the population to grow
- Let's break it down by race/ethnic group

## Whites

- Most of the 19th and 20th centuries, largest ethnic group was non-Hispanic whites
- They brought individualistic attitudes and values about demographic government and ideological support for slavery
    - While most did not own slaves, they supported it as an institution and believed in secession
- By the end of Reconstruction, three main values emerged which would define politics for the next 100 years:
    - One-party Democratic state
    - Provincialism
    - Business dominance
- However, this has largely changed—it's not safe to assume every white Texan owns a farm, holds culturally-conservative values, and votes Democratic
    - They may be an urbanite who is progressive or is a suburbanite who votes red

## Latinos

- Most Latinos in TX are of Mexican descent
- While early on there was significant Spanish and mixed Native-American/Spanish people, the influx of people into Texas due to political and economic stability in Mexico made the Latino population increasingly Mexican
    - In addition, other Latin American countries had the same issue, creating immigration into TX
- Politically, their status has changed considerably over the past 100 years
    - They had the ability to vote (not barred by a poll tax)
    - They were able to participate in traditionally white-dominated institutions (such as the Texas Senate)
    - By the 1980s, Latino political leaders play a growing role in state politics

## African-Americans

- While people of African descent were among the earliest explorers of TX, many were brought in as slaves from the South
- While initially anti-slavery attitudes prevented the slave population from growing, the annexation of TX from Mexico brought an increasing slave population (peaking at 1/3 of the state's pop.)
- Emancipation came on Juneteenth (June 19, 1865), but did not bring instant equality
    - Black Codes restricted the rights of former slaves, but government jobs were increasingly open
- However, at the end of Reconstruction brought the comeback of the Democratic Party in Texas, reversing a lot of the postwar progress
    - Things like the poll tax and the white-primary decreased the voting rate of African-Americans
- Some key Supreme Court decisions aided their fight for equality:
    - *Smith v. Allwright* outlawed the white primary
    - *Sweatt v. Painter* guaranteed African-Americans admissions to graduate/professional schools at state colleges/universities
    - *Brown v. Board of Education* ended segregation of public schools
- Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act helped open the political system even more
- Today, their population remains concentrated in East Texas, with smaller numbers migrating to Houston and Dallas

## Asian-Americans

- The Asian population has grown recently, including people from India, Vietnam, China, Pakistan, Korea, and Japan
    - Concentrated in West Houston, Fort Bend County, the suburbs of Dallas, Arlington, Austin

## Age

- The population of Texas is younger in comparison to the rest of the nation
- 26% of Texans are under 18 years old

## Poverty and Wealth

- Younger populations tend to be poorer, and while per capita income has lagged behind a lot of the nation, the poverty rate has been falling

# Urbanization

- **Urbanization ****= the process by which people move from rural to urban areas
- Texas cities are the result of American settlement and culture
- Has transformed Texas political life

## Urban Political Life

### Houston

- Population 2.3 million, 8 counties

### DFW Metroplex

- Population of 6.954 million, 3 main counties
- Dallas has a more corporate white-collar business culture

### San Antonio

- Texas's 2nd-largest city
- Lacks high-paying manufacturing jobs

### Austin

- State capital, home to UT (flagship institution)
