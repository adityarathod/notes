title: What if Texas Had Never Joined the Union?
---

# Intro
- This chapter explores the consequences of Texas not becoming a state

# Historical Background
- Pre-Colombian era: Texas was home to several Native American cultures
- The geographic area was the colony of six sovereigns at one time: Spain, France, Mexico, Republic of Texas, Confederate States of America, and United States
- Texas was supposed to come in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, but didn't get included
  - Americans still settled in Texas and raided territory
- Things changed when New Spain revolted against Spain and became independent (following the US's independence)
  - Opened up immigration to Mexico

# The Road to Independence
- The first group of colonists to settle in TX = Old Three Hundred, came under the empresario grants
- Pressure for annexation or independence of Texas grew, following the philosophy of Manifest Destiny
- The potential annexation of Texas would have been a big political move, since the US would be reneging on the Adams-Onís Treaty and also bringing another slave state to the Union (which meant the issue was split on North/South lines)
- When Mexico banned new American immigration, it continued illegally and hostilities became more apparent and the Texas Revolution began
- The most iconic battle was the Alamo, where Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett were killed
  - In response to the Alamo, Sam Houston's forces fought the Battle of San Jacinto and decisively defeated Santa Anna
- The Treaties of Velasco determined sovereignty from Mexico
- Keep in mind that since Mexico controlled a large portion of western North America, had Texas not fought the war and become independent, those parts would not have become part of the Union
- Then came a long journey for annexation by the US

# Different Counterfactual Histories for the Lone Star State
## Scenario 1: Santa Anna Fails
- One key aspect of Mexican politics at the time for independence was the fight between the Centralists and Federalists
  - Centralists: wanted a powerful unitary system
  - Federalists: wanted a decentralized (federal) structure where states had substantial autonomy
- Santa Anna was a Centralist—had Federalists won, things may have looked different
- When Mexico was first formed, it was a unitary government, which was not liked by the people (there were armed uprisings). While this was eventually reversed, the damage had already been done
