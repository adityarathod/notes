# Feature Creation
#wiki #cs4375 

A [[Data Preprocessing|data preprocessing]] method that creates new attributes which capture information more efficiently.

When the number of attributes is lower than the original, this is also [[Dimensionality Reduction|dimensionality reduction]].

## Methods
### Feature extraction
This approach requires taking the data and extracting features manually, either using another model or manually. For example, in a scan of a face, edges and highly-correlated areas may be extracted.

### Feature construction
This approach computes features from new ones. For example, mass and volume data can be used to compute density.
