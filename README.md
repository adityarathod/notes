# adityarathod/notes

This is a repository of notes taken throughout my undergraduate career. The software used to manage this vault of notes is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

To get started: open the [000 Index](000%20Index.md) root note. Note that LaTeX, tags, wiki-style links, and a couple of other features will not work on GitHub's built-in viewer. I'm working on getting a web version up Soon&trade; when I find an alternative to Obsidian Publish that works on GitHub Pages.
