# Datasets & Data Objects
#wiki #cs4375 #opre3360 

A **data object** is a set of **attributes** that capture the basic characteristics of an object.

A **dataset** is a collection of **data objects**.

## Key characteristics
### Dimensionality
- Also known as number of [[attributes]]
- High-dimensional data may be challenging to work with
    - This is why an important reason why we may preprocess data is to reduce its dimensionality

### Sparsity
- Some attributes have values of zero mostly, meaning only non-zero values need to be manipulated
- Saves time and storage

### Resolution
- Often possible to change the granularity at which data is given
- Too fine: pattern may be hidden/may be buried in noise
- Too coarse: pattern may disappear

## Quality
The quality of a dataset is important when drawing conclusions from it. Poor data quality negatively impacts data processing. Some things that lower a datasets quality are listed below.

### Noise
- Slightly incorrect data due to measurement error
- Can refer to:
    - Extraneous objects
    - Modified attributes (i.e. voice distortion)

### Outliers
- Objects with vastly different characteristics than most of the others
- May or may not be useful:
    - Useful: The goal of our analysis (e.g. credit card fraud)
    - Not useful: Interferes with our data analysis and adds noise to the data

### Missing values
- Reasons:
    - Information is not collected (e.g. people decline giving age or weight)
    - Attributes may not be applicable to all cases (e.g. children have no annual income)
- How to handle:
    - Ignore the missing values
    - Eliminate data objects or variables
    - Estimate missing values

### Duplicate Data
- Data objects that are the same or close to being the same
- Two main issues to address:
    - If the two represent one object, inconsistent values must be resolved
    - Be careful not to remove/combine similar but non-duplicate data objects

## Types
### Record
- Data that is a collection of records, each with a fixed set of attributes

#### Data matrix
- If data objects have the same fixed set of numeric attributes, we can think of each object as a point in multi-dimensional space
- Each attribute is a separate dimension
- Row: an object
- Column: a numeric attribute of the object
- Value: value of the attribute

#### Document data
- Each document becomes a vector of terms (where each term is a component/attribute of the vector)
- Row: a document
- Column: a word in the set of terms of interest
- Value: number of times the term appears in the document

#### Transaction data
- Each record is a transaction with a set of items (e.g. items purchased in a transaction)
- Row: a transaction
- Column: id + set of items
- Value: see column

### Graph
- A powerful way to capture connected data

#### Web
- The graph captures relationships among data objects
- For example: doc A refers to doc B, etc.

#### Intrinsically graphs (molecules)
- The graph shows data objects which are represented as graphs themselves
- For example: literal molecules, graph structures

### Ordered data
#### Sequential transaction
- For some types of data, the attributes have relationships that involve order in time or space
- An extension of record data where each record has a time associated with it
- Row: an object
- Column: id + set of (time, item) tuples
- Value: see column

#### Sequence
- A series of individual entities (i.e. words or letters)
- Similar to sequential transaction data, but no time stamps, just positions

#### Spatial
- Objects that have spatial attributes, such as positions
- For example: spatial temperature data (world temps)

## Example

| Student ID | Year      | GPA  |
| ---------- | --------- | ---- |
| 1234       | Freshman  | 3.24 |
| 5678       | Sophomore | 4.00 | 

Each row is a Student **data object**, with various attributes.
The **dataset** makes up the entire table.
