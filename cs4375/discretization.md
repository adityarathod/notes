# Discretization
A [[data-preprocessing]] method that converts a continuous attribute to a discrete attribute.

Discretization requires two main tasks to be performed:
1. **Determining how many categories are needed**: This will help determine how to split up the dataset into $n$ intervals via $n-1$ split points.
2. **Determining how to map values to categories**: Since all the values in an interval are mapped to the same category, this is pretty simple.

## Methods
### Equal interval width
This approach divides the range of the attribute into a specified number of same-width intervals.

### Equal frequency/depth
This approach divides the range such that the same number of objects in the dataset are in each interval.

### K-means clustering
This is where the K-means clustering algorithm is applied to one-dimensional, continuous data.
