#wiki #cs4375 

A form of [[data-preprocessing]] where two or more attributes or objects are combined into one attribute or object.

## Benefits
- Reduces the memory and processing time needed to use the data (since it's a smaller dataset)
- Provides a higher-level look of the data which is more stable than focusing on the details

## Drawbacks
- Potentially interesting details are lost
