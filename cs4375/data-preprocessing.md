# Data Preprocessing
#wiki #cs4375 

Modifications to the data done before utilizing the data to draw conclusions.

This may be done for a variety of reasons. Processing the entire dataset may be too expensive or time consuming, or may introduce data quality issues such as noise or outliers (see [[datasets-and-data-objects]]).

There are multiple types of data preprocessing:
- [[aggregation]]
- [[sampling]]
- [[dimensionality-reduction]]
- [[feature-subset-selection]]
- [[feature-creation]]
- [[discretization]]
- [[binarization]]
