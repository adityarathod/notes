**Statistics** is the study of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data. It is used colloquially to describe specific metrics analyzing the data, such as average or median.

There are two different subfields of statistics:

**Descriptive** statistics, which focuses on summarizing and presenting data in an easy-to-understand form, such as a table, graph, or summary statistic.

**Inferential** statistics, which utilizes a subgroup of a studied population (a sample) to make conclusions about the larger group.

The facts and figures of study in statistics are called **data**. A particular collection of **data** is called a [[Datasets & Data Objects|data set]].
