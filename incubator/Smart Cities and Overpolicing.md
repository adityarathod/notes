Smart Cities and Overpolicing

- popular buzzwords
- have the potential to make an outsized impact on a city
- wire up things that were previously dumb
- there are some that do more harm than good
- LinkNYC kiosk: installed all around New York City as a way to provide free Wi-Fi and telephone services
- to prevent vandalism, these things have cameras
- networked + cameras = mass survaillence perfect for policing
- what is that going to do? given existing efforts, predictive policing! which means overpoliced areas will now get algorithmically policed
- now we have taken something already systematic and ingrained it into the DNA of a city
- bad

==================

"Smart cities" have been a popular buzzword thrown around in a urban-planning context, with proponents citing it as the next step in technology's disruption of the world. As Deutsche Bank's Chief Product and Innovation Officer, Thomas Kiessling explains, infrastructure agumented by technology has the potential to reduce costs, increase resource utilization, and improve safety (Kiessling 338). Their potential to make an outsized impact at a time when municipalities were considering "excessive austerity measures" make them an attractive option to city planners (Kiessling 337). However, is wiring up everything that was previously "dumb" really a good idea? There is evidence to suggest that technology in this space has the potential to amplify systemic inequities that plague today's cities.

For instance, take this LinkNYC kiosk, which has the stated goal of replacing old, outdated pay phones with a modern, alternative to connecting people (Feature Diagram). It serves as an example of the quintessential smart city fixture; as visible in the image, these machines have Wi-Fi, a charger, maps and directions, and the ability to calls (Feature Diagram). However, something not visible in the image are the two cameras installed on every single kiosk ("Frequently Asked"). While the company running these kiosks claims not to store any footage or leave these cameras on by default, they do state that they provide such footage to law enforcement ("Frequently Asked"). Given that these cameras are outward-facing and have the potential to record anyone passing by, they are the perfect tool for conducting mass survaillence. The massive amount of data these machines have the potential to collect can only lead to the conclusion that any smart city device has the potential to collect an eye-watering amount of data on unsuspecting citizens compared to their "dumb" counterparts.

It is this very data that law enforcement agencies are after as part of their "predictive policing" efforts—initiatives that would allow law enforcement to allocate proper resources to high-crime areas. However, such efforts tend to end up perpetuating past overpolicing; in one review of the Los Angeles Police Department's program, they concluded that the program is "continuing to propagate a vicious cycle of disproportionately high arrests of black Angelinos [LA residents] as well as other racial minorities" (Robitzski). As journalist Dan Robitzski rightly points out, algorithms only perform as well as the data given to them, and skewed data will result in improper conclusions. Why, then, should smart cities feed into this pipeline? Until proper guidelines are established around limiting data collection and the usage of data across various parts of government, blindly trusting the buzzwords could cost more than expected.
