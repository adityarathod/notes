- Maximum-subarray problem
- Square matrix multiplication
- Exponentiation
- etc.

## Maximum-Subarray Problem

- Take an array of numbers and determines the contiguous subarray whose values have the greatest sum.
    - Bruteforce: O(n^2)
    - Divide-and-conquer: O(n log n)
- Sourced from maximum stock price problem

### Bruteforce solution

- Try every possible pair of buy and sell dates (there are $n\choose 2$ (n choose 2) such pairs)
    - This is $\Theta(n^2)$ and since the best we can hope is the evaluate all date pairs in constant time, it would also be $\Omega (n^2)$
- Can we do better?

### A transformation

- We want to find a sequence of days where the delta is max
- We can find the maximum subarray sum to simplify this problem

### Divide-and-conquer

- Divide the subarray into two subarrays of as equal size as possible (A[low:mid] & A[mid+1:high]
- Any contiguous subarray A[i:j] of A[low:high] must lie in one of the following:
    - Entirely in A[low:mid] s.t. low ≤ i ≤ j ≤ mid
    - Entirely in A[mid+1:height] s.t. mid ≤ i ≤ j ≤ high
    - Crossing the midpoint s.t. low ≤ i ≤ mid ≤ j ≤ high
- The algorithm:

```
FindMaxSubarray(A, lo, hi)
	if hi == lo:
		return (lo, hi, A[lo])
	else:
		mid = floor((lo + hi) / 2)
		left_lo, left_hi, left_sum = FindMaxSubarray(A, lo, mid)
		right_lo, right_hi, right_sum = FindMaxSubarray(A, mid + 1, hi)
		cross_lo, cross_hi, cross_sum = FindMaxCrossingSubarray(A, lo, mid, hi)
		if left_sum ≥ right_sum and left_sum ≥ cross_sum:
			return (left_lo, left_hi, left_sum)
		elif right_sum ≥ left_sum and right_sum ≥ cross_sum:
			return (right_lo, right_hi, right_sum)
		else:
			return (cross_lo, cross_hi, cross_sum)
```

## The Maximum-Subarray Problem

- **Straightforward method**: Just multiply and add like how we do in math
- **Divide-and-conquer**:

# Computational Geometry

- Deals with algorithms that solve geometric problems
- Input: description of a set of geometric objects
Output: a response to a query about the objects

## Finding the convex hull

- The *convex hull* of a set $Q$ of points (denoted by $CH(Q)$) is the smallest convex polygon $P$ for which each point in $Q$ is either on the boundary of $P$ or in its interior
- We assume Q contains at least 3 points that are collinear and all points in Q are unique
- Methods to solve this problem:
    - Graham's scan: O(n log n)
    - Incremental method
    - Divide-and-conquer method: O(n log n)
    - Prune-and-search method: O(n log h)

### Graham's scan

- Maintains a stack S of candidate points and pushes
