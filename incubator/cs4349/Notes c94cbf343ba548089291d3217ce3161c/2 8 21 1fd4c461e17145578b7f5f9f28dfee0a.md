# The Hiring Problem

- You are using an employment agency to hire a new office assistant, and they send you one candidate each day
- You interview the candidate and immediately decide if you want to hire that person—if you do, you must fire your current office assistant (regardless of whether or not you just hired them)
- It costs $c_i$ to interview each candidate, and $c_h$ cost to hire each candidate
    - Assume $c_h>c_i$
- You want to hire the best candidate you've seen so far. So you must hire and fire as such.
    - Based on this, you must hire the first person you interview
- Pseudocode for this algorithm:

```
HireAssistant(n)
	best = 0
	for i = 0 to n
		interview(i)
		if candidates[i] > candidates[best]:
			best = i
			hire(i)
```

## Examples

- How many hires will occur here?
    - `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`
        - 10, because at each step you hire that person
    - `A = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`
        - 1, because you hire the first person and then everyone's worse
    - `A = {5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 7, 10, 9, 3, 6}`
        - 3, because you hire the first person, then hire the person who's 8 and then the person who's 10

## Cost

- If we have $n$ candidates, and we hire $m$ of them, the cost is $O(n c_i + m c_h)$
- No matter how many people we hire, we always incur the cost $n c_i$ associated with interviewing
- How must we analyze $m c_h$, the hiring cost, which varies each run?
- This is a common problem: Find the maximum/minimum in a sequence by examining each element and maintaining a current "winner"

### Worst-case

- We hire all $n$ candidates—happens when they are ordered from low to high by quality
- If we hire all $n$, cost is $O(nc_i + nc_h) = O(nc_h)$ since $c_h >c_i$

### Average-case

- This is done with indicator random variables

# Probabilistic Analysis

- In general, we have no control over the order, so we can assume it's random
